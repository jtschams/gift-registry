Each user will answer questions ranging from general interests and favorite genres to specific gifts.  There will be a general set of questions available to everyone, and also the ability to add questions for the group.  Answers for general questions (e.g. interests or genres) will be simply visible, while answers for specific questions (e.g a specific gift or a certain book/movie) can be claimed.  A gift that will show as claimed to anyone looking to buy for the user, but not for the user themself.
